  You can easily switch datasets for pre-trained models with DVC.

  Sometimes your problem definition changes and you need to update your dataset.

## Intro

You might be in the middle of training a model and then the business problem
shifts. Now you have this model that has been going through the training process
with one dataset and now you need to use a different one.

There's likely something that your model learned that might be useful on this
new dataset, even though you'll have to restart the training process. We'll do
an example of updating a pre-trained model to use a different dataset. By the
end of this, you should see how you can handle this quickly and start running
new experiments.
