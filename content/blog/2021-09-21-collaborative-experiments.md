## Intro

Sharing experiments for machine learning is something that commonly happens. You
might have a new engineer join the team and you want to get their workspace
ready quickly. There might be times when someone might have an idea they could
try on your model if they could access your current progress.

Setting up DVC remotes lets you share all of the data, code, and hyperparameters
associated with each experiment so anyone can pick up where you left off in the
training process. We'll go through an example of sharing an experiment with DVC
remotes.
